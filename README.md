# Breast-cancer-detection
In this project, I am delving into the realm of deep learning for breast cancer detection, employing the VGG19 convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The primary focus is on exploring the intricacies of deep learning architectures and unraveling the distinctive characteristics inherent in each component.
